@article{Albert2014,
    abstract = {Tissue cells are in a state of permanent mechanical tension that is maintained mainly by myosin II minifilaments, which are bipolar assemblies of tens of myosin II molecular motors contracting actin networks and bundles. Here we introduce a stochastic model for myosin II minifilaments as two small myosin II motor ensembles engaging in a stochastic tug-of-war. Each of the two ensembles is described by the parallel cluster model that allows us to use exact stochastic simulations and at the same time to keep important molecular details of the myosin II cross-bridge cycle. Our simulation and analytical results reveal a strong dependence of myosin II minifilament dynamics on environmental stiffness that is reminiscent of the cellular response to substrate stiffness. For small stiffness, minifilaments form transient crosslinks exerting short spikes of force with negligible mean. For large stiffness, minifilaments form near permanent crosslinks exerting a mean force which hardly depends on environmental elasticity. This functional switch arises because dissociation after the power stroke is suppressed by force (catch bonding) and because ensembles can no longer perform the power stroke at large forces. Symmetric myosin II minifilaments perform a random walk with an effective diffusion constant which decreases with increasing ensemble size, as demonstrated for rigid substrates with an analytical treatment.},

@article{barterls1993myosin,
    abstract = {A decrease in the net fixed electric charge in the A-bands of cross-striated muscle was observed by Bartels and Elliott [2,10] when the muscle went from the rigor to the relaxed condition. The current work localises the source of the charge decrease by following the net charge on myosin (in the form of concentrated gels) and also myosin rod and light meromyosin gels when the gels are exposed to different concentrations of ATP. The work includes a study of muscle A-bands when the muscle is exposed to the same variations in ATP concentrations as the protein gels. The work shows that (i) Only 100-200 microns ATP is needed to initiate the charge decrease between the rigor and relaxed conditions; (ii) the effect of ATP is seen in the muscle A-band and the myosin and myosin rod gels, but not in LMM gels; (iii) pyrophosphate (PPi) shows a similar charge effect to ATP. ADP does not affect the charge on myosin gels, on the other hand. The results suggest that the charge decrease caused by ATP or PPi is due to ligand interaction with one or more sites on the myosin molecule. This interaction causes a disseminated effect in the protein, and a consequent loss in net negative charge either by a decrease in the absorption, of anions to Saroff sites on the protein, or, less probably, by an increase in the absorption of cations at those sites.},

    abstract = {The dwell times between two successive steps of the two-headed molecular motor myosin V are governed by non-exponential distributions. These distributions have been determined experimentally for various control parameters such as nucleotide concentrations and external load force. First, we use a simplified network representation to determine the dwell time distributions of myosin V, with the associated dynamics described by a Markov process on networks with absorbing boundaries. Our approach provides a direct relation between the motor's chemical kinetics and its stepping properties. In the absence of an external load, the theoretical distributions quantitatively agree with experimental findings for various nucleotide concentrations. Second, using a more complex branched network, which includes ADP release from the leading head, we are able to elucidate the motor's gating effect. This effect is caused by an asymmetry in the chemical properties of the leading and the trailing head of the motor molecule. In the case of an external load acting on the motor, the corresponding dwell time distributions reveal details about the motor's backsteps.},

    abstract = {The molecular motor myosin V has been studied extensively both in bulk and single molecule experiments. Based on the chemical states of the motor, we construct a systematic network theory that includes experimental observations about the stepping behavior of myosin V. We utilize constraints arising from nonequilibrium thermodynamics to determine motor parameters and demonstrate that the motor behavior is governed by three chemomechanical motor cycles. The competition between these cycles can be understood via the influence of external load forces onto the chemical transition rates for the binding of adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate. In addition, we also investigate the functional dependence of the mechanical stepping rates on these forces. For substall forces, the dominant pathway of the motor network is profoundly different from the one for superstall forces, which leads to a stepping behavior that is in agreement with the experimental observations. Our theory provides a unified description of the experimental data as obtained for myosin V in single motor experiments. ?? 2011 by the Biophysical Society.},

This is possible because actin filaments are semi-flexible polymers that, in conjunction with the molecular motor myosin, can act as biological active springs or "dashpots" (in laymen's terms, shock absorbers or fluidizers) able to exert or resist against force in a cellular environment. To modulate their mechanical properties, actin filaments can organize into a variety of architectures generating a diversity of cellular organizations including branched or crosslinked networks in the lamellipodium, parallel bundles in filopodia, and antiparallel structures in contractile fibers. In this review we describe the feedback loop between biochemical and mechanical properties of actin organization at the molecular level in vitro, then we integrate this knowledge into our current understanding of cellular actin organization and its physiological roles.},

No significant differences were found in their clinical daytime and nighttime behavior or in IQ tests, although in some of the psychodevelopmental tests minor signs of anxiety were revealed.

Tension gradients result in local contractions and drive cell deformations. Previous cortical tension regulation studies have focused on myosin motors. Here, we show that cortical actin network architecture is equally important. First, we observe that actin cortex thickness and tension are inversely correlated during cell-cycle progression. We then show that the actin filament length regulators CFL1, CAPZB and DIAPH1 regulate mitotic cortex thickness and find that both increasing and decreasing thickness decreases tension in mitosis. This suggests that the mitotic cortex is poised close to a tension maximum. Finally, using a computational model, we identify a physical mechanism by which maximum tension is achieved at intermediate actin filament lengths. Our results indicate that actin network architecture, alongside myosin activity, is key to cell surface tension regulation.},

@article{kishino1988force,
    abstract = {Single actin filaments (approximately 7 nm in diameter) labelled with fluorescent phalloidin can be clearly seen by video-fluorescence microscopy. This technique has been used to observe motions of single filaments in solution and in several in vitro movement assays. In a further development of the technique, we report here a method to catch and manipulate a single actin filament (F-actin) by glass microneedles under conditions in which external force on the filament can be applied and measured. Using this method, we directly measured the tensile strength of a filament (the force necessary to break the bond between two actin monomers) and the force required for a filament to be moved by myosin or its proteolytic fragment bound to a glass surface in the presence of ATP. The first result shows that the tensile strength of the F-actin-phalloidin complex is comparable with the average force exerted on a single thin filament in muscle fibres during isometric contraction. This force is increased only slightly by tropomyosin. The second measurement shows that the myosin head (subfragment-1) can produce the same ATP-dependent force as intact myosin. The magnitude of this force is comparable with that produced by each head of myosin in muscle during isometric contraction.},

The translational and rotational diffusion coefficients are measured for F -actin of lengths in the range of 1.5-5 microm. The length dependence of the measured diffusion coefficients is consistent with the predicted two-dimensional projection of the diffusion of a cylinder in an unbounded fluid. Fits based on the formulas for diffusion in the bulk fluid yield higher apparent viscosity values than that of the buffer solution by a factor of 2 for a layer thickness between 0.7 and 1.6 microm.

@article{ma2012nonmuscle,
    abstract = {During vertebrate cytokinesis it is thought that contractile ring constriction is driven by nonmuscle myosin II (NM II) translocation of antiparallel actin filaments. Here we report in situ, in vitro, and in vivo observations that challenge this hypothesis. Graded knockdown of NM II in cultured COS-7 cells reveals that the amount of NM II limits ring constriction. Restoration of the constriction rate with motor-impaired NM II mutants shows that the ability of NM II to translocate actin is not required for cytokinesis. Blebbistatin inhibition of cytokinesis indicates the importance of myosin strongly binding to actin and exerting tension during cytokinesis. This role is substantiated by transient kinetic experiments showing that the load-dependent mechanochemical properties of mutant NM II support efficient tension maintenance despite the inability to translocate actin. Under loaded conditions, mutant NM II exhibits a prolonged actin attachment in which a single mechanoenzymatic cycle spans most of the time of cytokinesis. This prolonged attachment promotes simultaneous binding of NM II heads to actin, thereby increasing tension and resisting expansion of the ring. The detachment of mutant NM II heads from actin is enhanced by assisting loads, which prevent mutant NM II from hampering furrow ingression during cytokinesis. In the 3D context of mouse hearts, mutant NM II-B R709C that cannot translocate actin filaments can rescue multinucleation in NM II-B ablated cardiomyocytes. We propose that the major roles of NM II in vertebrate cell cytokinesis are to bind and cross-link actin filaments and to exert tension on actin during contractile ring constriction.},

@article{monier2010actomyosin,
    abstract = {Partitioning tissues into compartments that do not intermix is essential for the correct morphogenesis of animal embryos and organs. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain compartmental cell sorting, mainly differential adhesion, but also regulation of the cytoskeleton or of cell proliferation. Nevertheless, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that keep cells apart at boundaries remain unclear. Here we demonstrate, in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos, that actomyosin-based barriers stop cells from invading neighbouring compartments. Our analysis shows that cells can transiently invade neighbouring compartments, especially when they divide, but are then pushed back into their compartment of origin. Actomyosin cytoskeletal components are enriched at compartmental boundaries, forming cable-like structures when the epidermis is mitotically active. When MyoII (non-muscle myosin II) function is inhibited, including locally at the cable by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI), in live embryos, dividing cells are no longer pushed back, leading to compartmental cell mixing. We propose that local regulation of actomyosin contractibility, rather than differential adhesion, is the primary mechanism sorting cells at compartmental boundaries.},

@article{nie2014conformational,
    abstract = {A long-standing controversy on the mechanism of an actomyosin motor is the role of the Brownian motion of the myosin head in force generation. In order to shed light on this problem, we calculate free-energy landscapes of interaction between an actin filament and the head (S1) of myosin II by using a coarse-grained model of actomyosin. The results show that the free-energy landscape has a global gradient toward the strong-binding site on actin filament, which explains the biased Brownian motion of myosin S1 observed in a single-molecule experiment [Kitamura et al., Nature, 1999, 397, 129 and Biophysics, 2005, 1, 1]. The distinct global gradient in the landscape is brought about only when the conformation of loop 2 at the actin interface of myosin S1 is flexible. The conformational flexibility of loop 3 also contributes to the gradient in the landscape by compensating the role of loop 2. Though the structure of loop 2 is expanded in the weak-binding state, loop 2 shows the larger fluctuation of compaction and expansion due to the actin-myosin interactions as myosin S1 moves toward the strong-binding site on actin filament. Hence, the increase in the compaction-expansion fluctuation of loop 2, the stronger binding of myosin to actin, and the biased Brownian motion of myosin S1 are coupled with each other and should take place in a concurrent way. This predicted coupling should provide opportunities to further test the hypothesis of the biased Brownian motion in actomyosin.},

@article{Nie2014,
    abstract = {An important unresolved problem associated with actomyosin motors is the role of Brownian motion in the process of force generation. On the basis of structural observations of myosins and actins, the widely held lever-arm hypothesis has been proposed, in which proteins are assumed to show sequential structural changes among observed and hypothesized structures to exert mechanical force. An alternative hypothesis, the Brownian motion hypothesis, has been supported by single-molecule experiments and emphasizes more on the roles of fluctuating protein movement. In this study, we address the long-standing controversy between the lever-arm hypothesis and the Brownian motion hypothesis through in silico observations of an actomyosin system. We study a system composed of myosin II and actin filament by calculating free-energy landscapes of actin-myosin interactions using the molecular dynamics method and by simulating transitions among dynamically changing free-energy landscapes using the Monte Carlo method. The results obtained by this combined multi-scale calculation show that myosin with inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ADP weakly binds to actin and that after releasing Pi and ADP, myosin moves along the actin filament toward the strong-binding site by exhibiting the biased Brownian motion, a behavior consistent with the observed single-molecular behavior of myosin. Conformational flexibility of loops at the actin-interface of myosin and the N-terminus of actin subunit is necessary for the distinct bias in the Brownian motion. Both the 5.5-11 nm displacement due to the biased Brownian motion and the 3-5 nm displacement due to lever-arm swing contribute to the net displacement of myosin. The calculated results further suggest that the recovery stroke of the lever arm plays an important role in enhancing the displacement of myosin through multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis, suggesting a unified movement mechanism for various members of the myosin family.},

@article{pollard1982structure,
    abstract = {Acanthamoeba myosin-II forms filaments of two different sizes. Thin bipolar filaments 7 nm wide and 200 nm long consist of 16 myosin-II molecules. Thick bipolar filaments of variable width (14-19 nm) consist of 40 or more myosin-II molecules. Both have a central bare zone 90 nm long and myosin heads projecting laterally at the ends. The heads are arranged in rows spaced 15 nm apart. In the case of the thin myosin-II filaments there are two molecules per row. The thick filaments are formed rapidly and reversibly in the presence of 6-10 mM MgCl2 (or any of five other different divalent cations tested) by the lateral aggregation of thin myosin-II filaments. Acid pH also favors thick filament formation. Neither the myosin-II concentration (50-1,000 micrograms/ml) nor ATP has an effect on the morphology of the filaments. The polymerization mechanism was studied quantitatively by measuring the amount of polymer formed (Cp) under various conditions as a function of total myosin-II concentration (Ct). Above a critical concentration of 15-40 micrograms/ml, Cp was proportional to Ct with a slope of 0.5-0.95 depending on conditions. In the range of 0.8-4.9 heavy chain phosphates per molecule, phosphorylation has no effect on the morphology of either the thin or thick myosin-II filaments and only a small effect on the extent of polymerization.},

Symmetry conditions for the appearance (or not) of directed current, its inversion upon variation of certain parameters, and quantitative theoretical predictions for specific models are reviewed as well as a wide variety of experimental realizations and biological applications, especially the modeling of molecular motors.

We elucidate the prominent physical concepts and novel phenomena with a representative dissipative Brownian motor dynamics. Its main ingredient is a thermal noise with time-dependent temperature modulations that drive the system out of thermal equilibrium in a spatially asymmetric (ratchet-) potential. Yet, this asymmetric setup does not exhibit a concomitant obvious bias into one or the other direction of motion. Symmetry conditions for the appearance (or not) of directed current, its reversal upon variation of certain parameters, and various other generic features and applications are discussed. In addition, we provide a systematic classification scheme for Brownian motor models and review historical landmark contributions to the field.},

@article{rosenblatt2004myosin,
    abstract = {The role of myosin II in mitosis is generally thought to be restricted to cytokinesis. We present surprising new evidence that cortical myosin II is also required for spindle assembly in cells. Drug- or RNAi-mediated disruption of myosin II in cells interferes with normal spindle assembly and positioning. Time-lapse movies reveal that these treatments block the separation and positioning of duplicated centrosomes after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), thereby preventing the migration of the microtubule asters to opposite sides of chromosomes. Immobilization of cortical movement with tetravalent lectins produces similar spindle defects to myosin II disruption and suggests that myosin II activity is required within the cortex. Latex beads bound to the cell surface move in a myosin II-dependent manner in the direction of the separating asters. We propose that after NEBD, completion of centrosome separation and positioning around chromosomes depends on astral microtubule connections to a moving cell cortex.},

These studies, in combination with in vivo work, define the mechanism by which molecular motors exchange cargo while traveling between filamentous tracks and deliver it to its destination when going from the cell center to the periphery and back again.},

@article{saito1994movement,
    abstract = {Movement of single myosin filaments, synthesized by copolymerization of intact myosin and fluorescently labeled light meromyosin, were observed along a single actin filament suspended in solution by a dual laser trap in a fluorescence microscope. The sliding velocity of the myosin filaments was 11.0 +/- 0.2 micron/s at 27 degrees C. This is similar to that of actin moving toward the center from the tip (the physiological direction) of myosin filaments bound to a glass surface but several times larger than that in the opposite direction (Ishijima and Yanagida, 1991; Yanagida, 1993). This indicates that the movement of myosin filaments is dominated by the myosin heads on one side of the myosin filament, which are correctly oriented relative to the actin filament. The incorrectly oriented myosin heads on the other side do not interfere with the fast movement. The step size (displacement produced during one ATPase cycle) of correctly oriented myosin was estimated from the minimum number of myosin heads necessary to produce the maximum velocity. This was determined by measuring the velocities of various lengths of myosin filaments. The minimum length of the myosin filaments moving near the maximum velocity was 0.30-0.40 microns, which contains 20 +/- 5 correctly oriented myosin heads. This number leads to a myosin step size of 71 +/- 22 nm. This value probably represents the lower limit, because all of the myosin heads on the filament would not always interact with the actin filament. Thus, the myosin step size is considerably larger than the length of a power stroke expected from the physical size of a myosin head, 10-20 nm (Huxley, 1957, 1969).},

We calculate their efficiency at maximum power output for two simple generic models and show that the qualitative behaviour depends crucially on the position of the transition state. Specifically, we find a transition state near the initial state (sometimes characterized as a "power stroke") to be most favorable with respect to both high power output and high efficiency at maximum power. In this regime, driving the motor further out of equilibrium by applying higher chemical potential differences can even, counter-intuitively, increase the efficiency.},

@article{stam2015isoforms,
    abstract = {Myosin II isoforms with varying mechanochemistry and filament size interact with filamentous actin (F-actin) arrays to generate contractile forces in muscle and nonmuscle cells. How myosin II force production is shaped by isoform-specific motor properties and environmental stiffness remains poorly understood. Here, we used computer simulations to analyze force production by an ensemble of myosin motors against an elastically tethered actin filament. We found that force output depends on two timescales: the duration of F-actin attachment, which varies sharply with the ensemble size, motor duty ratio, and external load; and the time to build force, which scales with the ensemble stall force, gliding speed, and environmental stiffness. Although force-dependent kinetics were not required to sense changes in stiffness, the myosin catch bond produced positive feedback between the attachment time and force to trigger switch-like transitions from transient attachments, generating small forces, to high-force-generating runs. Using parameters representative of skeletal muscle myosin, nonmuscle myosin IIB, and nonmuscle myosin IIA revealed three distinct regimes of behavior, respectively: 1) large assemblies of fast, low-duty ratio motors rapidly build stable forces over a large range of environmental stiffness; 2) ensembles of slow, high-duty ratio motors serve as high-affinity cross-links with force buildup times that exceed physiological timescales; and 3) small assemblies of low-duty ratio motors operating at intermediate speeds are poised to respond sharply to changes in mechanical context—at low force or stiffness, they serve as low-affinity cross-links, but they can transition to force production via the positive-feedback mechanism described above. Together, these results reveal how myosin isoform properties may be tuned to produce force and respond to mechanical cues in their environment.},

@article{yogurtcu2012mechanochemical,
    abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, actin filaments are involved in important processes such as motility, division, cell shape regulation, contractility, and mechanosensation. Actin filaments are polymerized chains of monomers, which themselves undergo a range of chemical events such as ATP hydrolysis, polymerization, and depolymerization. When forces are applied to F-actin, in addition to filament mechanical deformations, the applied force must also influence chemical events in the filament. We develop an intermediate-scale model of actin filaments that combines actin chemistry with filament-level deformations. The model is able to compute mechanical responses of F-actin during bending and stretching. The model also describes the interplay between ATP hydrolysis and filament deformations, including possible force-induced chemical state changes of actin monomers in the filament. The model can also be used to model the action of several actin-associated proteins, and for large-scale simulation of F-actin networks. All together, our model shows that mechanics and chemistry must be considered together to understand cytoskeletal dynamics in living cells.},
